# midterm-submission
The test_setup.py is the file where I did my preliminary analysis, but I commented it out.  
The feature_extraction.py just run it after changing the address of training data and testing data and sample data. The work I've tried is commented out and the remaining is what I used for submission.  
The analysis.py is the file I used to train the models and make predictions, just run the file it will work. And all tries of other models and operations which is not used are commented.
